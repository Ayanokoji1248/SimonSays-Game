# SimonSays-Game


### About the Project
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simon Says is a memory game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The game gets progressively more challenging as the sequence becomes longer with each successful round.
